# Notes

These notes are mostly created during personal study of lecture materials, solely for my own use. I don't have a goal of creating compherensive notes that cover all of aspects of all topics. Feel free to use them as you want, but they may contain typos and some parts that are hard to understand, skip some topics, or contain unrelated material.
